**Gisma Airline's Passengers Satisfaction - Classification Model**
Predict Passenger Satisfaction using Kaggle dataset and Keras NNs.

üìÇ Project Overview
Goal: Predict is_canceled to help revenue management & overbooking.
Data: Kaggle ‚Äì Hotel Booking Demand (119,390 rows, 30 features).
Methods: One-Hot Encoding, Scaling, SMOTE; 10 NN variants with Dropout & BatchNorm.
Outcome: Best model (3-layer NN) ‚Üí Val Acc 86.8%, Test Acc 87.3%, F1 83.1%.
üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand
Target: is_canceled (0/1)
üß≠ Approach
Cleaning (fix NA, drop invalid rows, remove company)
EDA (lead time distribution, correlation heatmap)
Preprocess (ColumnTransformer: scale num + OHE cat)
Balance (SMOTE)
Modeling (10 NN configs; early stopping)
Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1; Confusion Matrix)
ü•á Results
Best: Model-8 (256-128-64 + Dropout 0.1 + BatchNorm)
Test: Acc 87.3% ‚Ä¢ Precision 82.1% ‚Ä¢ Recall 84.1% ‚Ä¢ F1 83.1%
Insights: Lead time strongly drives cancellations; ADR has weak correlation.
